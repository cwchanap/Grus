# Host Migration Test Results

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Connection Object Not Updated**

- **Problem**: When a player joined a room, the WebSocket connection object wasn't updated with playerId and roomId
- **Fix**: Added `connection.playerId = playerId; connection.roomId = roomId;` in the join handler

### 2. **Async/Await Mismatch**

- **Problem**: `broadcastToRoom` is synchronous but was being awaited in `handleDisconnection`
- **Fix**: Removed `await` from `this.connectionPool.broadcastToRoom()` calls

### 3. **Better Error Handling**

- **Problem**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')" errors
- **Fix**: Added validation for message data and better JSON parsing error handling

### 4. **Connection Cleanup**

- **Problem**: Connection objects weren't properly cleared when players left
- **Fix**: Clear playerId and roomId when handling leave-room messages

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Player joins room**: Connection object gets updated with playerId and roomId
2. **Player disconnects**: `handleDisconnection` can properly identify the player and room
3. **Host migration**: `removePlayerFromRoom` is called, which triggers host migration logic
4. **Remaining players**: Receive WebSocket messages about the host change
5. **UI updates**: Frontend should receive and process the host migration messages

## Test Scenario

1. Host creates room "Test Room"
2. Player joins as "Player 2"
3. Host disconnects (closes browser/tab)
4. Player 2 should become new host automatically
5. UI should update to show Player 2 as host with host controls

## Server Logs to Look For

```
WebSocket disconnection - playerId: [host-id], roomId: [room-id]
Processing disconnection for player [host-id] in room [room-id]
Broadcasting player-left message to room [room-id]: {...}
Broadcasting host-changed message to room [room-id]: {...}
Host migration completed: [old-host] -> [new-host] in room [room-id]
```

## Client Logs to Look For

```
Host migration detected: {type: "host-changed", ...}
```

The key fix was ensuring that the WebSocket connection object maintains the playerId and roomId so that disconnections can be properly processed and trigger the host migration logic.
