# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a real-time multiplayer drawing and guessing game built with Deno Fresh and deployed to Cloudflare Workers. Players can create or join game rooms, take turns drawing while others guess, and compete for points based on how quickly they guess correctly. The game utilizes Pixi.js for the drawing engine and Cloudflare storage services for data persistence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to access a game lobby where I can see available rooms and create new ones, so that I can easily find or start a multiplayer drawing game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the main screen THEN the system SHALL display a game lobby interface
2. WHEN the lobby loads THEN the system SHALL show a list of available game rooms with room names and player counts
3. WHEN a user clicks "Create Room" THEN the system SHALL create a new game room and make the user the host
4. WHEN a user clicks "Join Room" on an available room THEN the system SHALL add the user to that room if space is available
5. WHEN a room reaches maximum capacity THEN the system SHALL disable the join option for that room

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to participate in a drawing game with multiple components including a drawing board, chat room, and scoreboard, so that I can have a complete gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player enters a game room THEN the system SHALL display the game play screen with drawing board, chat room, and scoreboard components
2. WHEN it's a player's turn to draw THEN the system SHALL enable drawing tools on the Pixi.js drawing board for that player only
3. WHEN other players are guessing THEN the system SHALL allow them to send messages in the chat room
4. WHEN a correct guess is made THEN the system SHALL update the scoreboard with points based on guess timing
5. WHEN the drawing board is updated THEN the system SHALL broadcast changes to all players in real-time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game host, I want to manage turn rotation and game flow, so that all players get equal opportunities to draw and the game progresses smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new round starts THEN the system SHALL select the next player in rotation to be the drawer
2. WHEN a player is selected to draw THEN the system SHALL notify all players who the current drawer is
3. WHEN all players have had a turn drawing THEN the system SHALL notify the host that a complete round is finished
4. WHEN a round is complete THEN the system SHALL allow the host to choose between ending the game or starting a new round
5. WHEN the host chooses to start over THEN the system SHALL reset the turn rotation and begin a new round

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to earn points based on how quickly I guess correctly, so that there's competitive incentive to guess faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player makes a correct guess THEN the system SHALL award points inversely proportional to the time taken
2. WHEN multiple players guess correctly THEN the system SHALL award higher points to faster guessers
3. WHEN a round ends THEN the system SHALL display updated scores for all players
4. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL display final rankings based on total points
5. WHEN points are awarded THEN the system SHALL persist the scores using Cloudflare storage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use Cloudflare infrastructure for deployment and storage, so that it can scale efficiently and integrate with the deployment platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL run on Cloudflare Workers
2. WHEN game data needs to be stored THEN the system SHALL use Cloudflare D1 or KV storage
3. WHEN real-time communication is needed THEN the system SHALL use WebSockets compatible with Cloudflare Workers
4. WHEN static assets are served THEN the system SHALL leverage Cloudflare's CDN capabilities
5. WHEN the application scales THEN it SHALL handle multiple concurrent game rooms efficiently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want real-time communication and drawing synchronization, so that the multiplayer experience feels responsive and synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player draws on the board THEN the system SHALL broadcast drawing actions to all other players within 100ms
2. WHEN a player sends a chat message THEN the system SHALL deliver it to all room participants immediately
3. WHEN a player joins or leaves a room THEN the system SHALL notify all other participants
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect and sync the current game state
5. WHEN drawing data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL optimize for minimal bandwidth usage while maintaining drawing quality
