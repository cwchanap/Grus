## Deployment Process

### Pre-Deployment
1. [ ] Run pre-deployment checks (`deno task pre-deploy`)
2. [ ] Verify all tests pass
3. [ ] Check current production status
4. [ ] Notify team of deployment
5. [ ] Prepare rollback plan

### Deployment
1. [ ] Deploy to staging first
2. [ ] Run smoke tests on staging
3. [ ] Verify staging functionality
4. [ ] Deploy to production
5. [ ] Monitor deployment progress

### Post-Deployment
1. [ ] Run smoke tests on production
2. [ ] Verify health check endpoint
3. [ ] Check monitoring dashboards
4. [ ] Verify key functionality works
5. [ ] Monitor error rates and performance
6. [ ] Update deployment documentation

## Rollback Checklist

### When to Rollback
- [ ] Smoke tests fail
- [ ] Critical functionality broken
- [ ] High error rates (>5% in production)
- [ ] Performance degradation (>50% slower)
- [ ] Security vulnerability introduced

### Rollback Process
1. [ ] Identify the issue
2. [ ] Execute rollback command (`wrangler rollback`)
3. [ ] Verify rollback successful
4. [ ] Run smoke tests on rolled-back version
5. [ ] Notify team of rollback
6. [ ] Document the issue and resolution

## Environment-Specific Checklists

### Development Environment

- [ ] Production logging levels
- [ ] Staging-specific monitoring

### Production Environment
- [ ] All security measures enabled
- [ ] Production logging configuration
- [ ] Full monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Backup systems operational
- [ ] CDN and caching enabled

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Issues
1. [ ] Assess impact and severity
2. [ ] Notify on-call team immediately
3. [ ] Consider immediate rollback
4. [ ] Implement temporary fixes if needed
5. [ ] Document incident for post-mortem

### Communication
- [ ] Update status page if available
- [ ] Notify stakeholders
- [ ] Provide regular updates
- [ ] Document resolution steps

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### First 30 Minutes
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Check response times
- [ ] Verify key functionality
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Check WebSocket connections

### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Check for any user reports
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Verify backup completion
- [ ] Review logs for issues

### First Week
- [ ] Analyze performance trends
- [ ] Review user feedback
- [ ] Check for memory leaks
- [ ] Verify monitoring accuracy
- [ ] Plan any necessary optimizations

## Documentation Updates

### After Each Deployment
- [ ] Update deployment log
- [ ] Document any issues encountered
- [ ] Update runbook if needed
- [ ] Share lessons learned with team
- [ ] Update this checklist if needed

### Regular Reviews

**Remember**: When in doubt, don't deploy. It's better to delay a deployment than to cause an outage.

**Emergency Contact**: [Your on-call contact information]
**Rollback Command**: `wrangler rollback`
